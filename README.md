# WordLadder
CS146 Assignment:
Write a program in Java to solve the following word ladder puzzles based on the list of all five-letter words given below: word.ladder.txt
The file has 5758 words (nodes in the graph)
Number of buckets = 20860
Max bucket size = 13
Number of edges = 28296

Note that for the runtime efficiency, you must follow the approach in the reference to build the Word Ladder Graph by using a bunch of "buckets" as shown below.
